Monsters/Monster_toejammer=Палезатор
Monsters/Monster_toejammer_bio=Adult Toe Jammers have a great bubbly personality and are very good swimmers when they live in the wate. Also known to get invited to many parties and picnics with their fellow friend Floot-Fly, they know how to have a good time!!!

Monsters/Monster_toejammer_rare=Редкий Палезатор
Monsters/Monster_toejammer_rare_bio=While the common Toe Jammer is a well known partygoer, this rare variant is far more accustomed to stay at home experiences, especially of the snacking kind. With some handy snackholding pegs included, there's no adventure the Rare Toe Jammer can't handle- from the comfort of a couch that is.

Monsters/Monster_potbelly=Брюшок
Monsters/Monster_potbelly_bio=The adult potbelly is a loud and extroverted creature, constantly babbling nonsense to everyone who can hear. Whilst other monsters would love to stay around and listen, eventually a potbelly may take off its pot and settle into the jabber, sometimes not even noticing the rooty tendrils engulfing it’s eager listener. Luckily, these days monsters have learned to stay away or gently remind the potbelly, and things go smooth from there.
Monsters/Monster_tweedle=Легптица
Monsters/Monster_tweedle_bio=Adult Tweedles are known to migrate a lot from island to island, sometimes they travel to visit their friends while they also sometimes live on one once they get to understand it a lot with the help of their fellow monsters, a true adventuring bird we must say!!!
Monsters/Monster_flootfly=Мухофлейт
Monsters/Monster_flootfly_bio=The mystical Floot Fly is one of the most common monsters to stumble upon throughout the Lost Landscapes, as it's one of the friendliest monsters around! Floot-Flies love to throw tea parties in the most bizarre locations too! Invites to a tea party are always revered and accepted gleefully, as it's a great place to socialize and gossip!
Monsters/Monster_choral=Хоррал
Monsters/Monster_choral_bio=Huh? This seems to be an ordinary tree, but consider us fooled, as this is the shy protege of the Cancer Choir, Choralle! These small masters of natural trickery use a tree-like figure for protection, usually hiding from bigger monsters who usually mean no harm, as they just want to say hello! But being the introverted species they are, the Choralle produce a powerful slam with their disguise if someone gets too close. It may seem rude, but it's just instinct, which we can't blame them for.
Monsters/Monster_likho=Урыло
Monsters/Monster_likho_bio=If you see a Yap, just know that you've just run into a nice chap! Yaps are small little tumbleweeds, rolling around picking up all sorts of plant life, and usually gifting some to others, even if they don't like it as much as the gifter. But not only that, when it stops, it prepares a... "wonderful" song for its comrades, which usually results in its audience screaming "MAKE IT STOP!" Don't know what that's about.
Monsters/Monster_oaktopus=Осьмидуб
Monsters/Monster_oaktopus_bio=Oaktopi are packed full of wisdom to share with the world, about the world. They almost always have an answer to some of life's most burning questions; "Why is the sky blue?", "Is water wet?", and most notably, "Is mayonnaise an instrument?" (The answer is inconclusive, there is no mayonnaise monster). Sometimes they even say outlandish claims of islands once being carried by towering creatures across the monster world. Psh, yeah right. An Oaktopus can usually be seen reading a good book or swimming in a local hot spring.

Monsters/Monster_oaktopus_rare=Редкий Осьмидуб
Monsters/Monster_oaktopus_rare_bio=Sporting a pair of handy appendages, Rare Oaktopus has taken up a long time dream of being a Chemist! This wooden wizard travels the realm searching for new ingredients, from the blood of a slumbering giant to the sap of a sugary paradise. Most recently, the Rare Oaktopus has discovered that if mixed in proper proportion to other ingridients, the water of a distant marsh had hallucinogenic effects when sipped; Fascinating! 

Monsters/Monster_wadee=Вади-ной
Monsters/Monster_wadee_bio=Deep below the murkiest of murky depths lies an underwater land lost to time. Many monsters have resided here, and in recent times, many from this region have adventured to the surface. If one takes a swim at the foggy center of the Evergreen Woods’ bog pools then you might hear the soggy "why" like sounds of a Wadee, one such explorer. While it was a beautiful fish in the deep, exposure to the surface has fundamentally changed it, causing its gills to shrink, it’s flippers to turn to hands, and it’s body to swell slightly. While seeming minor, these changes mean that the Wadee can no longer make the long underwater trek back home. The Wadee takes it kindly though, and uses its glowing pads to help guide other underwater travelers, and is a friend to many above and below the surface. Deep inside though, Wadee misses the sights of its home coral reef and the sounds of the Cancer Choir’s melodious tunes…
Monsters/Monster_quibble=Клавмный
Monsters/Monster_quibble_bio=The Quibble may seem like a graceful monster on the outside, but that's just a facade. The two heads constantly bicker, usually having polar opinions about the latest trends, or some other trivial issue. One time, the left Quibble wanted to order fries, but the right Quibble was eager to get a milkshake... chaos ensued. But in the end, they always make up with each other, like true siblings. Oh yeah, they ended up ordering fries dunked in a milkshake. A... unique consensus
Monsters/Monster_stoopa=Ступа
Monsters/Monster_stoopa_bio=Not much is known about the misty marsh deep in the heart of the Evergreen Woods, but legends speak of a strange monster that watches over and leads the song of the monsters that reside there. And whaddya know, here it is! Stoopa is even more of a recycling expert than Congle, finding anything and everything in nature to produce its song, even if it has to make some exceptions with its nature-based rule at times- proven by those... pots and pans on its stupa? Still very little is known about it, and Stoopa prefers to keep it that way while it wields its strange staff, and guards the secrets of the Marsh.
Monsters/Monster_bridgit=Троллита
Monsters/Monster_bridgit_bio=While the marsh is a special haven for Faerie elementals, I bet you didn’t expect this one here! Believe it or not, a special gene deep within the mind of this crystalline connoisseur’s mind calls all Bridg-its to seek out marshy depths. While these days, most that find such a place go through a very unique and dramatic change to suit their environment, this odd specimen feels itself already, and is content as it is! A Gold Star for Great Body Image goes to our Evergreen Marsh Bridg-it!
Monsters/Monster_spunge=Гупка
Monsters/Monster_spunge_bio=Adult Spunges are very talented whistlers, they can blow so hard that sometimes they send fellow monsters off to faraway islands!!! Just Remember to take cover when they blow their birthday candles

Monsters/Monster_spunge_rare=Редкая Гупка
Monsters/Monster_spunge_rare_bio=The dry-eyed Rare Spunge is a fascinating example of the adaptations that environment based mutations can bring about. Seeming to stem from particularly composed waters, mutations through this wacky spunge have changed almost everything about this Spunge, from its color to the amount of each organ it has. Some even suspect it may have a second mouth inside of its body. Ew. Just Ew. 

Monsters/Monster_percFrog=Амфиритм
Monsters/Monster_percFrog_bio=Amphibeat is a frog. How did you even get this monster? Did you get the combo from my 20k special video? If not then idk..    Azu wuz here :3
Monsters/Monster_phangler=Фанглер
Monsters/Monster_phangler_bio=It appears that the lukewarm waters around the marsh are quite the welcoming enviroment. Many monsters come up to the surface to enjoy them, including the Wadee, the Banno, and more! It appears some monsters also make the land journey at times! One such example is Phangler, who must have adventured all the way from the jungley shore, through the Evergreen Woods to get to the water. Phangler says its arguably the second-sweetest place in the world- and who can blame em?

Monsters/Monster_phangler_rare=Редкий Фанглер
Monsters/Monster_phangler_rare_bio=Rare Phangler bio

Monsters/Monster_dulsylvan=Древован
Monsters/Monster_dulsylvan_bio=The carved Dulsylvan, a creature of wood and weathering, held together by its solid core, may seem a tad bit rude on first encounter. Known to never speak, and always donning a scowl, Dulsylvan’s bad mood is naught more than circumstance, as it’s mouth has long been cemented in that shape. In truth, the true monster lives in the small creatures that reside upon the only truly life-filled part of the being, it’s lofty twigs. These creatures, sometimes referred to as Sylvlings, cover and open holes on their ailing ancestors branches to allow air through, and giving the Dulsylvan a means of communication with its neighbors. Once Dulsylvan mystically changes into a pine cone, the Sylvlings will begin to grow and change rapidly, into young Dulsylvans of their own!

Monsters/Monster_dulsylvan_rare=Редкий Древован
Monsters/Monster_dulsylvan_rare_bio=During the late stages of a Dulsylvan’s time, it’s body begins to rapidly change. Old, solid wood morphs into a light airy shape, known as a sylvcone. The Dulsylvan’s body begins to ooze a sweet sap, that will feed its young Sylvlings after it has passed on, and it’s nose changes to a luscious green shade. While these latter days are considered to be short, they are known to be filled with joy, as the old Dulsylvan becomes able to move freely once more! Eventually though, it slows down, and the sap crystallizes the sylvcone and preserves it for eternity…

Monsters/Monster_dandidoo=Дендиптица
Monsters/Monster_dandidoo_bio=As the warm flows of the ocean carry oysters around the deeps, a gentle breeze carries Dandidoo across the monster world. Their migrations rely on airflow since nature wasn't kind enough to grant them wings. They can conduct the air through their bodies to store and burst it out in a powerful stream of tuned tones and semitones. That's why their singing resembles "doo"s and "dee"s.\nTheir plant element gave them a greenish hue and afro-styled hair reminiscent of a common dandelion.
Monsters/Monster_varrow=Варда
Monsters/Monster_varrow_bio=Known for its penchant for hunting, the melodic “Yah-ha-ha!” of the Varow echoes throughout all corners of the Evergreen Swamp. It uses its call and prolonged noseharp to attempt to attract juvenile fwogs to its corner of the swamp, even though it might not work as often as it likes. In fact, its attempts more often scare its slippery prey away, leaving the Varow fwogless and alone. It’s a sad thing too, since it truly just wants new customers to sample their fresh home-made sweets!

Monsters/Monster_varrow_rare=Редкая Варда
Monsters/Monster_varrow_rare_bio=What do you find when you place a needle inside a nutshell, inside a berry, in a cloth, place it in a chest, and bury it at the bottom of the marsh's waters? A Rare Varow, that's what! These queer monsters have a penchance to anything puzzling and paradoxical- including themselves! While it's unknown how these odd monsters came into existence, they're here to stay, boasting their garments and trinkets from distant lands and giving everyone something to ponder every chance they get...

Monsters/Monster_banno=Баннокер
Monsters/Monster_banno_bio=Banno is a vocalist of the legendary Cancer Choir, for a long time he spent his time in the deep cold depths of the ocean. Sadly though, it was far too cold for his hot water-loving body! Instead of moving into a geyser of some sort, he decided to stay close to his friends, utilizing an endlessly boiling bucket to keep comfy. Whilst his boiling red abdomen may be concerning, there’s no need to worry- Banno states that it’s just his natural color showing after the cleaning of thousands of years of sea gunk.
Monsters/Monster_banno_rare=Редкий Баннокер
Monsters/Monster_banno_rare_bio=Редкий Баннокер был здесь (твёрк)

Monsters/Monster_frondley=Пальмуг
Monsters/Monster_frondley_bio=The Frondley is an ammmmmmmmmmazing specimen! Its gelatinous physique and toes bring to mind some similar monsters, but they have evolved separately from our lemon-colored companions. Their otherworldly and serene hums echo throughout islands, always making sure a Frondley's presence is known. Some monsters go as far as to record these hums to lure themselves to sleep. In other activities, Frondley enjoys maintaining their kelpy hairdos, while always striving to find the perfect amount of hair for their bulbous craniums.

Monsters/Special/Monster_melochness=Гармонесси
Monsters/Special/Monster_melochness_bio=Born from the Enchanted Ponds in the Deep Woods, Meloch-Nesses are curious colossal creatures. Like most of the Faerie Forests' inhabitants, this monster's existence is tied heavily to the Flora Fog. While we still don’t know exactly what it does, the Fog seems to amplify Meloch-Ness’s to melodic tunes and carry far and wide. Its enchanting melody can be heard from a whole forest away when it's is carried by the Flora Fog. In fact, it was the first thing the natural monsters heard when they arrived in the Deep Woods. Meloch-Ness is also said to share a common ancestor with Reedling and Blabbit.

Monsters/Monster_toejammer_young_bio=Effervescent and bubbly, tropical-demeanored Young Toe Jammers are always pleasant playmates for the other monsters. At times, situations can get a little sticky when a tossed ball finds itself lodged in the gelatinous body of this tot, but that's no match for some well executed laughter therapy.

Monsters/Monster_oaktopus_young_bio=While they may appear to be like leaves atop a tree, the bubbles adorning an Oaktopus sapling's crown is more akin to that of deep-sea waterfoam! While far-removed from the Living Ocean amidst the Lost World, Oaktopus youngsters still find a way to stay moist, even if it means rooting around in the local Fountain of Gob.

Monsters/Knott_1=Дерево Неуверен
Monsters/Knott_1_bio=This creature, despite not looking sylvan, is an ent. It's the next point in evolution of the Surr trees, conifers found across the island. Its bark is almost pertified and impenetrable by most of the vermins and predators. Yet a particular species of "Plantcarver nymph" have developed strong teeth that can gnaw away the stone bark and settle inside of the everblue. The tree's bark is extremely resonant from the inside. Allowing nymths to sing while inside and resonate a deep-throated, ear-piercing sound. The holes carved away by the nymphs resemble a face to scare away unwanted guests and attend on the yearly spooktackle decoration contest.

Monsters/Knott_3=Сосуд Дууш
Monsters/Knott_3_bio=The Souxls[SOULS] - A collection of vengeful psyches with a very licentious spirit and a strong power of will. The task of keeping them must be assured to be in good hands. Or a hand in this case.\nThe keeper's adamant fingers and immeasurable strength make them a perfect fit for the job, yet even they are having a hard time maintaining the restless Souxls at repose. As for why these Souxls are so restless? Nobody knows...
Monsters/Knott_4=БуУуу
Monsters/Knott_4_bio=All those who hail from the Thumpiverse are well versed in the practice of interdimensional leaps, and BoOoo is no exception. Fleeing the abysmal depths of its former home, BoOoo embarked on a long and widespread journey for a new home. Eventually, it found a strange mountain, deep below the Silver Crags, that emitted a strange feeling that resonated with BoOoo. At first staying to investigate, the cryptic aura of the region has convinced BoOoo to finally choose a true home for the first time in millennia. However, no gift comes without its price, and without careful consumption of local materials, the region’s alien magic might take hold on BoOoo and the other residents in strange ways… 
Monsters/Knott_5=Гора Туцпик
Monsters/Knott_5_bio=Mount Tuzzpikk was a regular Knott-rock that got affected by the Knottsurr magic, emmited from the mystical orbs found across the Knottsurr Island. It gained musical abilities and immediately after being animated, started to sing. It knows many compositions but "Pearrdesh Slougna" and "Ellepharrth" by "DJ. Goldenduck" is the closest to its rock heart. You can find it humming the melody non-stop whenever it's not singing.\nLeaving the island would result in reverting to its initial state of non-sentience. Unless it carries one of the sources of Knottsurr magic with it wherever it goes.
Monsters/Knott_6=Гораоотвод
Monsters/Knott_6_bio=Mount Mound bio
Monsters/Knott_7=Пушинкас
Monsters/Knott_7_bio="Flocca! Flocca!"\nCan be heard whenever this monster is around. Floccas are cratures made of pure bone, held together by magic and plucktape. The skull of this cheerful maracc-oss player somehow grew furr and functioning ears and eyes. Giving the sense of sight and sound. Adding to that the sense of Oss-ception is present. Sense that gives an ability to feel the presense of other bones from far far away and easily identifying types of bones and skeletons. Also Oss-ception helps to identify any types of bone injuries, helping monsters around in case of an accident.
Monsters/Knott_8=Клеомолот
Monsters/Knott_8_bio=Cleomace bio
Monsters/Knott_9=Бабушка Неувязья
Monsters/Knott_9_bio=Meet the friendliest creature in the Lost world. The elderly Babushka Knittshurr is a motherly creature that acts as a nurturer to any monster kind there is. It uses its knitting skills to keep their adopted grandchildren in warmth and welfare and usually never leaves their sight. Most of the representatives of the species are several millenia old, and seem to never visually change after hitting a milestone of 80 years.\nDespite all of that, there are specimens that had a tragic past and never recovered since. Those exemplars tend to be more aggressive towards everyone around.

Monsters/Monster_whimstlop=Свистель
Monsters/Monster_whimstlop_bio=The inner machinations of the Whimstlop are an enigma. What's seen on the outside of this passive monster is merely a suit of armor, with its "helmet" portion enlarged by the wielding of discarded armor from its youth. Its organic aspects lie beneath its metallic sheathing, with the only visible parts being a singular eye (it lost the other one) and two twig-like legs (surprisingly strong given the burden of lifting its armor). Depending on its environment, a Whimstlop can don an armor of a different material to fit its current needs. Sometimes they work as part-time leafblowers, expelling much of the dirt and grime its other monster pals bring in.

Nobody is quite sure, including the Loch-nitt itself; The lavender legend just calls them l'arms! When not questioning it's own existence, this monster mystery's passions include knitting neck socks, stumbling over just about anything, and passionately playing it's clumsy heart out on its lyrologs. It's always careful not to break the strings, as they're handmade by another knitting monster from a distant land.
Monsters/Monster_bone=Амонитерий

While its own origins remain a mystery, it can only imagine how it was created. No matter what, one thing's for sure: we know it'll become a part of the identity of every bone in the Amoniterium's well outfitted body!

It's a very patient Monster, who looks forward every year to Anniversary Month when it throws a huge party for the migratory Seasonals coming home to roost!

Decoration/Dog=Гончая
Decoration/Dog_bio=Это самый хороший мальчик в мире. Лучше этого пса нигде не найти. Он умеет выполнять множество разных команд, пойдёт за вами куда-угодно, очень воспитан, много еды не просит, всегда будет предан любому монстру и человеку, помогает по хозяйству, хорошо готовит, читает сказки на ночь (тем не менее он остаётся молчалив) и профессионально водит машину. Гончая создавал невероятные творения, такие как "Джаконда Мона Лиза", "Чёрный квадрат", "3 Медведя" и другие, он спроектировал и сам построил статую Свободы и Эйфелеву башню. Гончая неоднократно прослеживался во многих исторических событиях. Он ветеран 2 мировой и очень гордится этим званием. Он написал первую книгу, открывал Олимпийские игры и был в них судьей. Да что уж там Олимпийские игры, Гончая основал сам Рим! Он изобрёл колесо и объяснил людям как делать инструменты. И самое главное, благодаря Гончей люди добыли огонь. Все говорят, то что человек приручил волка, но это не так! На самом деле Гончая приручил человека и внушил что его родственники ему не враги. Поговаривают что из-за него и случился тот самый большой взрыв когда он случайно чихнул. У этого пса очень богатая история. И знаете, на вашем месте я бы его боялся...
